# Hidden_directory_dictionary
In this project with url we need to give wordlist file(directories) to access and get directory of url present in  network
The Wordlist (common.txt) file you can get if you have kali linux there they provide this file to get directories.
To see this file >goto > terminal > type $locate dirb> there you type > cd /usr/share/dirb , then copy that file by > cp wordlist /home/(that is destination where directories python file is available)
For demo example you can enter ip address of virtual machine in the (enter URL field) & common.txt file in (enter directories field).

If you didn't find this file then search on google or get it from github. (for all directories) 
Thank you
